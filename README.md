# Code challenge

**About the solution**

Main idea is to traversal the table in a spiral-like manner - start from outer edges and after each layer, we'll switch to nearest inner layer till we reach to the last element or last edge. In order to implement this algorithm, we need to 4 pointers each of them pointing to an edge where we should move on.
